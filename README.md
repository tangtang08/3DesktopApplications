1) The Commission app is a company app. I use swing To help the company figure out how much commission is owed to the sales reps. This app is still being worked on 
2) The Water Consumption desktop app, tells the user how much water to consume. Based on their body weight.
3) Programming that you like helps a someone who is interested in programming. Figure out if they would perfer to work Front-end, 
Backend or as a full stack developer.
